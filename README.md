## Installation

_Note: Requires [Python] 3.7.0 or newer with PIP installed._

```shell
$ python setup.py install
```

You now have the `imaginepy` package installed.

### From Source Code

The following steps are instructions on download, preparing, and running the code under a Venv environment.
You can skip steps 3-5 with a simple `python setup.py install` call instead, but you miss out on a wide array of benefits.

1. `git clone https://github.com/hyugogirubato/pyImagine`
2. `cd pyImagine`
3. `python -m venv env`
4. `source env/bin/activate`
5. `python setup.py install`

As seen in Step 5, running the `pyimagine` executable is somewhat different to a normal PIP installation.
See [Venv's Docs] on various ways of making calls under the virtual-environment.

## Usage

The following is a minimal example of using pyImagine in a script. It gets the generated image
from the text and increases the quality.

```python
from pyimagine import Imagine, Style, Ratio

def main():
    imagine = Imagine()

    img_data = imagine.sdprem(
        prompt="Woman sitting on a table, looking at the sky, seen from behind",
        style=Style.ANIME_V2,
        ratio=Ratio.RATIO_16X9
    )

    if img_data is None:
        print("An error occurred while generating the image.")
        return

    img_data = imagine.upscale(image=img_data)

    if img_data is None:
        print("An error occurred while upscaling the image.")
        return

    try:
        with open("example.jpeg", mode="wb") as img_file:
            img_file.write(img_data)
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"An error occurred while writing the image to file: {e}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
