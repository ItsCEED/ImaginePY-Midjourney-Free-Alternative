## Installation

```
pip install imaginepy
```

### From source code

The following steps are instructions on download, preparing, and running the code under a Venv environment. You can skip steps 3-5 with a simple `python setup.py install` call instead, but you miss out on a wide array of benefits.

1. `git clone https://github.com/ItsCEED/ImaginePy-Midjourney-Free-Alternative`
2. `cd ImaginePy-Midjourney-Free-Alternative`
3. `python -m venv env`
4. `source env/bin/activate`
5. `python setup.py install`

As seen in Step 5, running the `imaginepy` executable is somewhat different from a normal PIP installation. See [Venv's Docs](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html) on various ways of making calls in the virtual-environment.
